###How is this project made?
The source code is available [here on github](https://github.com/ClydeDz/marcdown). It is primarily made using Angular JS with the help of the following libraries.
1. [Angular Marked](http://hypercubed.github.io/angular-marked/) - which does the super-processing of converting the input that you type to a Markdown output.  
2. [Angular File Saver](http://alferov.github.io/angular-file-saver/) - which enables us to save the content that you type into a text file and a Markdown file.  
3. [Pdfmake-Browserified](https://github.com/xErik/pdfmake-browserified) - enables us to save the contents that you type into a pdf document. This project highlights the use of Pdfmake-browserified in an Angular JS app in the most simplest form.  
4. [PdfMake](http://pdfmake.org/) - is a brilliant client/server side PDF printing using JavaScript. This is the underlying script file that is used by Pdfmake-browserified.  
5. [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) - the super-heroic framework for creating expressive and extraordinary web apps. This web app is built on AngularJS which allows us the ability to create a well managed and expressive view (HTML content) along with a well structured and readable JavaScript code. It is flexible and easy for you to get started with your project.
6. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - the best framework for developing responsive, mobile first web projects.
7. [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) - for the lovely \(and easy to use\) icons.
